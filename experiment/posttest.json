        "a": "It is used to mimic manufacturing defect within a circuit",
        "b": "Individual signals can be stuck at logical '0' or '1'",
        "c": "They can always be detected in a circuit",

      "explanations": {
        "a": " An encoder can be a transducer because it converts one form of data (e.g., decimal input) into another form (e.g., binary output), which is the function of a transducer.",

      "question": "What happens to the logic of a wire initially at logic 1 when passing through two SA0 faults?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Becomes 0 after the first SA0 fault and remains 0 after the second SA0 fault",
        "b": "Remains 1 after both SA0 faults",
        "c": "Changes to 0 after the first SA0 fault and again changes to 1 after the second SA0 fault",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A Stuck-at-0 (SA0) fault forces the signal to 0, and once a wire is stuck at 0, it remains 0 even if it passes through additional SA0 faults.",
